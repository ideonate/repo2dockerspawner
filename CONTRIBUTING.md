Contributing to Ideonate / ContainDS Projects
=============================================

We welcome contributions to our [open source projects on Github](https://github.com/ideonate).

Issues
------

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests via GitHub Issues.

Please also [get in touch](https://cdsdashboards.readthedocs.io/en/stable/chapters/contact.html) with any questions or feedback, or for help in working with the software. These 
actions are valuable contributions in their own right.

Contributing
------------

In general, the projects follow the "fork and pull request" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NB: Make sure you merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
